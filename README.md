 To make a dataset, a working bank has gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank. 
 I have built this Artificial Neural Network that can predict and also provide the probability, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn).
